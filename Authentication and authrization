Authentication and authorization are two key security concepts in Django (and web development in general). Hereâ€™s how they differ:

### 1. **Authentication (Who are you?)**
   - Confirms the identity of a user.
   - Ensures that users provide valid credentials (e.g., username and password).
   - Django handles authentication via `django.contrib.auth`, which provides:
     - User model (`User` from `django.contrib.auth.models`)
     - Authentication backends (e.g., `authenticate()`, `login()`, `logout()`)
     - Built-in authentication views (e.g., login, logout, password reset)

   **Example:**
   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, login

   user = authenticate(username='john', password='secret')
   if user is not None:
       login(request, user)  # User is authenticated
   ```

### 2. **Authorization (What can you do?)**
   - Determines what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform.
   - Based on user roles and permissions.
   - Django provides a permissions system where each user or group can have specific permissions (e.g., `can_add_post`, `can_delete_user`).
   - Uses decorators like `@permission_required` and `@login_required`.

   **Example:**
   ```python
   from django.contrib.auth.decorators import permission_required

   @permission_required('app_name.can_add_post', raise_exception=True)
   def create_post(request):
       # Only users with the 'can_add_post' permission can access this view
       pass
   ```

### **Key Differences:**
| Feature            | Authentication | Authorization |
|-------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Purpose**      | Verifies identity | Determines access rights |
| **Question**     | "Who are you?" | "What can you do?" |
| **Implemented Using** | `authenticate()`, `login()`, `logout()` | Permissions, groups, `@permission_required` |
| **User Required?** | Yes | Only after authentication |
| **Example** | Logging in | Checking if user can edit/delete content |
